Jeff Stelling-inator

Rationale
--

Hearing "So and So really loves scoring about Arsehole united" from Jeff Stelling gets on my nerves. So I decided to write a script to annoy everyone else.


Install

You will need to run get_token.rb (Stolen with thanks from: http://blog.andrewcantino.com/blog/2011/05/12/how-to-make-your-rails-app-tweet-the-twitter/ ).

Then allow it and add the **SAVE THE KEYS** - You will need them to run


Running
--

After the above is done you're gravy. Run it as per:

```bash
JEFF_TOKEN=your_token_from_the_above_script JEFF_SECRET=your_secret_from_above ruby jeff.rb
```


Gotchas

Sometimes it shits it's self
